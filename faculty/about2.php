<p>
  Student Feedback System for college students have been developed which
  aims to rate and analyse the college facultyâ€™s performance. This type of
  Feedback system reduces the strenuous work of physically examining the
  feedback pages of each and every student. The system also reduces the
  burden of efforts and burden of keeping and maintaining the records
  on a manual base, it requires a lot of space and to keep up
  such records. This system can also be used to update subject related
  queries and allow students to interact with them and stay updated. Also
  the students feedbacks can be tempted for wrong reasons in case of paper
  based feedbacks wherein the SFS will always ensure of feedbacks privacy.
  Another important feature of the SFS is that physical presence of
  neither the admin nor the student is required for the either giving
  the feedback nor the assessing the feedback.
